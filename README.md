## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to get the project up and running on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

You will need the following software installed:
-   Python (version 3.8 - 3.10 recommended)
-   An environment manager like Anaconda/Miniconda or `venv`.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup

1.  **Clone or Download the Repository:**
    Get the Python script and save it in a new project folder.

2.  **Set Up a Clean Environment:**
    It is highly recommended to use a virtual environment.

    *Using Conda:*
    ```bash
    # Create a new environment
    conda create --name voicegym-env python=3.9 -y
    # Activate the environment
    conda activate voicegym-env
    ```

3.  **Install Required Libraries:**
    With your environment active, install all the necessary packages with `pip`.
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

### üîë Configuration

To use the AI voice and feedback features, you must configure your API keys.

1.  Create a file named `.env` in the same folder as your Python script.
2.  Add your secret API keys to this file in the following format:
    ```
    GEMINI_API_KEY="YOUR_GEMINI_API_KEY_HERE"
    MURF_API_KEY="YOUR_MURF_API_KEY_HERE"
    ```
3.  Open the main Python script and find the following line. Replace the placeholder with a real Voice ID from your Murf AI account (e.g., `"en-US-terrell"`).
    ```python
    # In the speak_feedback function
    "voiceId": "en-US-terrell",
    ```

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run

1.  Ensure your virtual environment is active (e.g., `conda activate voicegym-env`).
2.  Run the application from your terminal:
    ```bash
    python your_script_name.py
    ```
3.  A window will open with your webcam feed. Position yourself so the camera can see you and begin performing bicep curls.
4.  To stop the program, make sure the webcam window is active and press the **'q'** key or the **ESC** key.
